## Full Description (for Gumroad)

### Stop Writing Trading Bots From Scratch

Every developer who wants to trade algorithmically faces the same problem: piecing together data feeds, strategy logic, risk management, backtesting, and execution from scattered tutorials and half-baked libraries.

**This kit gives you everything you need in one professional package.**

### What You Get

**3 Complete Strategy Types**
- Momentum strategies (MA crossover, breakouts, time-series momentum)
- Mean reversion strategies (Bollinger Bands, RSI, pairs trading)
- Machine learning strategies (XGBoost, LightGBM, ensemble methods)

**Professional Risk Management**
- Position sizing: Kelly Criterion, Fixed Fractional, Volatility Targeting
- Stop losses: Fixed, Trailing, ATR-based
- Portfolio controls: Drawdown limits, sector exposure, correlation monitoring

**High-Performance Backtesting**
- Vectorized engine (1M+ bars/second)
- Realistic slippage and commission modeling
- Walk-forward optimization
- Monte Carlo simulation
- 20+ performance metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, etc.)

**Live Trading Ready**
- Alpaca integration (commission-free stocks)
- Interactive Brokers template (stocks, options, futures)
- Paper trading mode for safe testing
- Strategy runner with real-time execution

**Production Features**
- Data fetching with automatic caching
- Technical indicator library
- Comprehensive logging
- Clean, documented code

## Pricing Psychology

$24 is the sweet spot because:
- Low enough for impulse purchase
- High enough to signal quality
- Beats typical $49-99 trading tools
- Easy to justify ("costs less than 1 losing trade")

Consider adding a "Pro" tier at $49 with:
- Email support
- Strategy optimization service
- Custom indicator requests
